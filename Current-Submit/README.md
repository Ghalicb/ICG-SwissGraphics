# Assignment 8 : Lindenmayer Systems

## Description

The main part of this assignment was to implement a Lindenmayer system's generator.  
First, we implemented functions for the expansion of such L-systems. Then we built a finite state machine to register all the lines that need to be drawn for a certain level of expansion of an L-systems. And as a more advanced topic, we implemented stochastic L-systems.

On the second part, we had to understand how L-systems worked, by reverse-engineered them.   
Even if we could quickly find the rules for "basic" cases, we saw that it becomes much harder when we needed to use several variables.
