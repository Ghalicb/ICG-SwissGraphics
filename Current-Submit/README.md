# Assignment 5 : Transformations and Viewing

## Description
In this assignment, we placed object in the scene, placed the eye in the scene, rendered textured objects and responded to keyboard events

- We spend most of the time understanding how matrices modify objects positions and how they should be combined.
- Our first approach was to update planets' positions step by step. Finally, we decided to make use of the stored angle of orbit to compute the rotation from the initial position.
