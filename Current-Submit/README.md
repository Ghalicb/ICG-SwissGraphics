# Assignment 7 : Shadows and Cube Mapping

## Description

In this assignment, we implemented a real-time shadowing technique for multiple omni-directional point lights.

First we implemented the view and projection matrices for a cube face. For the view matrix, we struggled a bit figuring out which matrices to use in order to switch between the coordinates systems.

Then we worked on the fragment shader and implemented Phong lighting in it. Shadows were handled using shadow map. Sign of vectors and coordinates system were also the challenging part, as it can become quickly confusing.
