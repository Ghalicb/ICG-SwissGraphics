# Assignment 5 : Transformations and Viewing

## Description
In this assignment, we placed object in the scene, place the eye in the scene, rendered textered objects and responded to keyboard events

- We spend most of the time understanding how matrices modify objects positions and how they sould be combined.
- Our first approach was to update planet positions step by step. Finally, we decided to make use of the stored angle of orbit to compute the rotation from the initial position.
