# Title and Summary

Interactive ball thrower into water. The purpose of this project is to render fluids effects when solid objects controlled by the user are thrown into water.

# Goals and Deliverables
## Minimum Implementation
The minimal implementation consists of a static water volume modelisation that reacts to user's perturbation. (with object or not ? I would say yes) The water volume will be connex (no particules ejection)

## Optional Extensions
Implements better effects, with water ejection.
