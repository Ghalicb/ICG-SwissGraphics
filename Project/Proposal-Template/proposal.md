# Title and Summary

Improved ray tracer. The purpose of this project is to improve the ray tracer done during assignments to add support for indirect lightning, soft shadows, caustics, fluorescense and ray light.

# Goals and Deliverables
## Minimum Implementation

- The minimal implementation consists of ray tracer that implements indirect lightning, fluorescent objects and caustics. [Fig. 1]
- It will be implemented in C++.

## Optional Extensions
- Soft shadows
- light as rays


# Schedule
## Week 1
- Indirect lightning implementation.
## Week 2
- Fluorescent objects implementation.

## Week 3
- Caustics implementation.

## Week 4
- Soft shadows and ray lightning implementation.
- Bugs correction.

## Week 5
- Correct last minute problems.
- Render scene for submission.

# Workload
Dynamic and fair workload distribution
